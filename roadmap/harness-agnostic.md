# Harness-Agnostic — Roadmap

Pdeq 0.4.0 made the framework installable into and operable from multiple coding-agent harnesses (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Pi). The v1 cut intentionally kept the harness adapter table small and the slash-command surface Claude-only. This roadmap parks forward-looking ideas for that work.

See current state in [../product/harness-agnostic.md](../product/harness-agnostic.md).

> **Done in 0.8.0:** Native Pi `/pdeq-*` commands shipped — Pi reads markdown prompt templates from `.pi/prompts/*.md` (no TypeScript extension needed), so pdeq materializes the palette there directly. The pdeq setup skill is also exposed at `.pi/skills/`. See `../product/harness-agnostic.md`.

## V2

Larger directional bets.

- **Additional harnesses in the adapter table** — Cursor, Goose, Gemini, Copilot, AMP, Cline. Each has a documented `AGENTS.md` (or equivalent) convention per the `block/ai-rules` mapping table, so adding a row to the adapter table inside `scripts/init.sh` is a one-commit change per harness. Gated on actual user demand: pdeq has no evidence today that any of these matter to consumers. Add as users surface the need rather than speculatively.
- **MCP server configuration shipped per harness** — pdeq could provide a default MCP server config (e.g., for repo-aware grep/symbol lookup) that materializes into the right per-harness location (`.mcp.json` for Claude, `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor, etc.). Today pdeq ships no MCP. Worth revisiting if pdeq grows ambient capabilities that benefit from MCP exposure.
- **Neutral skill source + per-harness materialization** — 0.8.0 exposed the setup skill to Pi via a lightweight relative symlink to the single canonical `.claude/skills/pdeq/SKILL.md` (Pi consumes the same Agent Skills `SKILL.md` format). That works while only two harnesses consume the format. If a third skill-capable harness with a *different* skill shape appears, or if the skill needs to be materialized into consumer projects (it is a repo/global asset today, not installer-managed), promote the source to a neutral `pdeq-rules/skills/` path and add a `harness_skills_dir` adapter axis + `_materialize_skill` installer step, mirroring the commands design.

## Later

Speculative — only worth thinking about once the above lands and we have user feedback.

- **Adopt `block/ai-rules` as the materialization engine** — Today pdeq's per-harness adapter table is ~60 lines of bash in `scripts/init.sh`, and the install-dependency floor stays at `git + bash`. If pdeq grows beyond the three v1 harnesses and the table starts repeating logic that `block/ai-rules` already implements (per-harness MCP overlays, frontmatter-driven rule splits, generated-file tracking via `ai-rules status`), it may be worth swapping in the Rust CLI. Trade-off is a new install dependency for consumers, so the bar to switch is "the adapter table is meaningfully more work to maintain in-house than the dependency tax is to ask of consumers." Not there at v1.
- **Harness-aware audit** — `scripts/audit-traceability.sh` currently treats all `.md` files uniformly. Future harnesses might introduce per-harness command directories (e.g., `.cursor/commands/`) that should also be excluded from slug scans. The audit's exclude list could read pdeq.json's `harnesses` and dynamically extend its skip set. Cheap to do; gated on a real harness having an exclusion need that the current `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` filter doesn't already cover.
