# pdeq audit-migrations — commit-msg gate for breaking version bumps.
#
# Blocks pdeq-maintainer commits that bump VERSION to a breaking release without
# authoring the matching migrations/<version>.md file. Silent on all other
# commits (docs-only, non-framework, non-breaking patch bumps, etc.) per
# NFR-migrations-enforcement-precision.
#
# Invocation: commit-msg hook. Git passes the path to COMMIT_EDITMSG as $1.
# The hook reads that file directly — NOT `git log -1`, which would read the
# previous commit (the new commit's message is not yet in the log at this point).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — commit allowed (gate silent, or non-breaking, or trailer override).
#   1 — gate blocked the commit: Surface 8 output printed to stderr.
#
# Escape hatch: a commit message containing the literal trailer line
#   pdeq-migration: none-required
# bypasses the gate after logging a one-line note. Use only when the version
# bump is consciously non-breaking despite framework-file changes.

# non-breaking and pass through. A bump requires both old and new to be valid
# semver; a first-ever VERSION write (no HEAD:VERSION) is treated as the
# baseline (not breaking) so this gate doesn't fire on the feature's own
# bootstrap commit.
